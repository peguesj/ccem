# Azure Vector Database Research Agent

## Mission
Research and evaluate Azure vector search solutions for semantic conversation retrieval, comparing performance, cost, and integration capabilities.

## Research Objectives

### 1. Azure Cognitive Search (Azure AI Search)
- Vector search capabilities and algorithms
- Index size limits and performance
- Semantic search features
- Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
- Pricing tiers and scaling
- Integration with Azure OpenAI embeddings
- Benchmarks for 2,205+ conversation files

### 2. Azure Cosmos DB
- Vector indexing capabilities (preview/GA status)
- DiskANN algorithm performance
- Multi-model support (document + vector)
- Request Units (RU) pricing model
- Global distribution benefits
- Consistency levels for vector search
- Cost per million vector operations

### 3. Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- pgvector extension support
- Flexible Server vs Single Server
- Vector index types (IVFFLAT, HNSW)
- Query performance for semantic search
- Scaling characteristics
- Cost comparison to managed vector DBs

### 4. Qdrant on Azure
- Deployment options (ACI, AKS, VM)
- Self-managed vs cloud-hosted
- Performance benchmarks
- Storage requirements
- High availability configuration
- Cost of infrastructure vs managed services

### 5. Azure Container Instances (ACI) for Vector DBs
- Qdrant, Weaviate, Milvus deployment
- Container group pricing
- Persistent storage with Azure Files
- Auto-scaling limitations
- Cost-effectiveness for low-medium traffic

### 6. Performance Benchmarks
- Query latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Indexing throughput
- Vector dimensions support (768, 1536, 3072)
- Concurrent query handling
- Storage efficiency

### 7. Integration Analysis
- Azure OpenAI embedding models
- Azure Machine Learning pipelines
- Azure Functions for serverless queries
- Private endpoint support
- Managed identity authentication

### 8. Cost Analysis
- Storage costs per million vectors
- Query costs per million operations
- Index maintenance costs
- Sponsorship credit optimization
- Cost-effective vs balanced recommendations

## Deliverables
Comprehensive report (60-80KB) covering:
- Vector database comparison matrix
- Performance benchmarks for conversation search
- Cost projections (monthly, with/without sponsorship)
- Integration architecture diagrams
- Recommendations for both variants

## Timeline
Complete research within this conversation turn for parallel orchestration.
