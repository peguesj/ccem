# Azure AI Services Research Agent

## Mission
Research Azure AI and ML services for conversation processing, embedding generation, and analysis, with focus on cost optimization under sponsorship.

## Research Objectives

### 1. Azure OpenAI Service
- Embedding models (text-embedding-ada-002, text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-3-large)
- Pricing per 1M tokens
- Rate limits and quotas
- Batch API for cost reduction
- Deployment types (Standard, Provisioned Throughput)
- Regional availability
- Cost comparison: on-demand vs provisioned
- Integration with Azure Cognitive Search

### 2. Azure Machine Learning
- Managed online endpoints vs batch endpoints
- Cost per hour for inference
- Model deployment options
- Sentence Transformers hosting
- GPU vs CPU pricing
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- MLflow integration

### 3. Text Analytics API
- Sentiment analysis capabilities
- Entity recognition for conversation metadata
- Key phrase extraction
- Language detection
- Pricing per 1000 text records
- Comparison to Azure OpenAI for analysis tasks

### 4. Azure Cognitive Services
- Speech-to-Text (if audio conversations)
- Language Understanding (LUIS)
- QnA Maker integration
- Multi-service resource pricing

### 5. Self-Hosted Options on Azure
- Sentence Transformers on Azure ML
- Sentence Transformers on AKS
- Sentence Transformers on Azure Container Instances
- GPU instance pricing (NC-series, ND-series)
- Cost comparison: managed vs self-hosted
- Hugging Face model deployment

### 6. Embedding Strategy Comparison
- Azure OpenAI: Cost, performance, quality
- Self-hosted SBERT: Infrastructure cost, control
- Azure ML hosted transformers: Hybrid approach
- Batch processing optimization
- Caching strategies

### 7. Processing Pipeline Options
- Azure Functions for serverless processing
- Azure Logic Apps for orchestration
- Azure Data Factory for ETL
- Azure Synapse Pipelines
- Durable Functions for stateful workflows

### 8. Cost Optimization Strategies
- Batch API usage for embeddings
- Reserved capacity for Azure OpenAI
- Spot instances for self-hosted models
- Provisioned throughput vs pay-per-use
- Sponsorship credit allocation

### 9. Quality and Performance
- Embedding quality benchmarks
- Latency characteristics
- Throughput (embeddings/second)
- Model size vs performance trade-offs
- Multi-language support

## Deliverables
Comprehensive report (60-80KB) covering:
- AI service comparison matrix
- Embedding cost analysis (per million conversations)
- Performance benchmarks
- Processing pipeline architectures
- Recommendations for cost-effective vs balanced variants
- Sponsorship credit optimization strategies

## Timeline
Complete research within this conversation turn for parallel orchestration.
